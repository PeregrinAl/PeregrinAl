## About me

I enjoy building solutions that are meant to last: easy to maintain, easy to extend, and still readable months later. I like taking an idea from “draft” to a stable, working product with clear structure, measurable results, and solid documentation. I am especially interested in industrial and engineering domains, but I am open to other areas if the product and tasks are meaningful.
